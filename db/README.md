## Index.js
File for easier export and future proofing. Helpful for multiple database types, as you can change the active one 
or if you don't always have access to an central database, you can use a local one instead.

## SQLITE.js
File containg the sql(ite) functions for our database. Currently quite long, but each function is small and connected to each other.
